        This parameter is used to specify what level of capabilites
        the robot should have after this launch file.

        Possible values are 'core', 'teleop', and 'navigation'

        Since this launch brings up everything we expect 
        for teleop, it is set to 'teleop'.

       external device like a computer or cell phone. It adds security but doesn't improve performance.  -->
